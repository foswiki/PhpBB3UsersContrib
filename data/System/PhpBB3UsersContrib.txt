---+!! PhpBB3UsersContrib Contrib Package

*tested with phpBB3 v3.0.4*


This Contrib enables you to replace the Foswiki User and Groups system with a read only access to the 
User and Groups in a [[http://phpbb.com/][phpBB3]] Database. Registration of new users and their 
association with Groups is then _only_ handled by phpBB3, making it possible to remove the distributed Main web.

You are advised to use the same same host for Foswiki and the phpBB3 Database, 
otherwise user query performance (happens every request) will severely degrade the response time.

*NOTE:* for performance reasons, the phpBB3 Registered Users group is _not_ brought into the system.
The other groups may cause performance degradation if they have too many members

<!--
By selecting phpBB3Login, Foswiki will also attempt to use the phpBB3 'remember me' cookie - (CHECK THIS)
 though this requires the Foswiki and phpBB3 host names to be the same.
